# Summary
Nasa is the first thing comes to mind when we say space. They achieved too many things about earth and space its countless.Thats why we have to teach new generation.They don’t like read written documentary !! that’s why we have to use different way.They born with internet and technology so we couldn’t wait to same way how we learn.This Is a brand new platform for new generations which is supported with AR (Augmented Reality).It is more convenient and interesting for them to visualize.This app will be the new bridge between new generation and NASA. 

# How I Addressed This Challenge
Its mobile app.It is important because it will attract the attention of the new generation to NASA and space.This is a software that presents historical events of NASA by combining virtual and real environment.I want people to be more interested in NASA and space.
